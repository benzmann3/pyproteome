Welcome to pyproteome's documentation!
======================================

pyproteome is a Python package for interacting with proteomics data.

It includes modules for loading, processing, and analyzing data by mass
spectometry. This functionality allows users to automatically merge separate
data sets together, cluster peptides that show correlated changes, and perform
enrichment analysis to study cell signaling pathways.

This package is designed to be used within an interactive computational
environment, such as Jupyter notebook, alongside other data analysis packages.
This allows scientists to update their processing parameters and re-generate
all figures automatically.

To install it, just type `pip install pyproteome`. Python 2 is supported, but
it is recommended to use Python 3. Windows users may wish to use Anaconda to
manage their Python environment and provide pyproteome's dependencies.

Currently pyproteome only supports data produced by MASCOT / Discoverer.
